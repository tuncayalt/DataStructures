# DataStructures

My implementations of various generic data structures. I am implementing them with TDD. The ones that are already implemented are:

1. List implementations
- List with array
- Linked list

2. Stack implementations
- Stack with array
- Stack with linked list

3. Queue implementations
- Queue with array
- Queue with linked list

4. HashTable implementations
- HashTable with array and linked list

5. Heap implementations
- MinHeap with array
- MaxHeap with array
